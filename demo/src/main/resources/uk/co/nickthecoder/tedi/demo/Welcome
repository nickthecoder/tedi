Welcome to the TediArea Demo

This is a demo application, showing how to use some of the features
of TediArea, and its helper classes, such as FindBar, ReplaceBar,
TediAreaMatcher and GotoDialog.

The contents of these tabs are from this demo's jar file.

The Demo and DemoWindow tabs contain the Kotlin source code for this
application.

The Example tab contains the source code for a simpler application
to this one, but written in Java. It is also much simpler, as it only
has one TediArea (there is no TabPane).

Note. The Demo and DemoWindow tab use the kotlin syntax highlighter,
whereas the Example tab uses the java syntax highlighter. They are
very similar, but have a different set of keywords, and the kotlin's
semi-colons are highlighted in RED ;-)

Also note that the source code shown here may not be the latest version,
so please check the code on github.

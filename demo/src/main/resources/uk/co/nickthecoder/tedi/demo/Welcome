Welcome to the TediArea Demo

This is a demo application, showing how to use some of the features
of TediArea, and its helper classes, such as FindBar, ReplaceBar,
TediAreaMatcher and GotoDialog.

A few keyboard shortcuts used in this demo :
    ctrl+PLUS  : Increase Font Size
    ctrl+MINUS : Decrease Font Size
    ctrl+2     : Split/Un-split (two TediArea's sharing the same content)
    ctrl+F     : Find
    ctrl+R     : Replace
    ESCAPE     : Hide Find/Replace tool bars
    ctrl+G     : Go To Line:Column
Plus the usual keys for undo/redo/copy/cut/paste

The contents of these tabs are from this demo's jar file.

The Demo tab contain the Kotlin source code for this application.

The Example tab contains the source code for a similar application
to this one, but written in Java. It is also much simpler, as it only
has one TediArea (there is no TabPane or SplitPane).

Note. The Demo tab use the kotlin syntax highlighter,
whereas the Example tab uses the java syntax highlighter. They are
very similar, but have a different set of keywords, and the kotlin's
semi-colons are highlighted in RED ;-)

This is a regular TextArea.

Here's some differences between this TextArea, and TediAreas :

    The word selection is worse (for source code at least!).
        Try double clicking inside : "GotoDialog.createGotoButton" and
        compare it by double clicking the text in DemoWindow.

    Tab and shift+Tab in a TextArea are useless when a block is selected.

    The "line numbers" button (ctrl+L) won't work here or course!

Both TextArea and TediArea extend TextInputControl, so they can be
used somewhat interchangeably.
There are exceptions though. Most notably undo/redo is different when
using BetterUndoRedo.
The demo uses BetterUndoRedo, and therefore the code is a little
cumbersome to switch behaviours for TediArea and TextArea.
However, if BetterUndoRedo wasn't being used, then the demo could use
the same undo/redo code for TediArea and TextArea.

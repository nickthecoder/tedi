Bugs

Demo is sluggish moving the caret position. Is this because of the column/line number at the top?
    I don't remember it being sluggish before.
    Maybe because its creating threads for the various extensions. Reuse existing threads?

Current Work
------------

Remove delegatedObsList

pageUp/down

Sort out vScroll value with large padding

Current-line highlighting.
    Extra code in the factory :
        If index == current line, then add the rectangle
        Fire 2 paragraph changes whenever the current line changes

Current line highlighting in the gutter

Get rid of skin.tmpText

Use TextFlow?
    May need to perform layout() with vv to get its true height.

Get rid of the jittery text (hopefully TextFlow will help)

Have two modes for the horizontal scroll :
    When wrapping is disabled. The node's heights are calculated using -1.0 (i.e. limitless)
    When wrapping is enabled. The node's heights are calculated using the viewport width
        In which case, never show the scrollbar???

Next
----

selection is using tempText, rather than the real Text objects.

Later
-----

Only place those paragraphNodes which are VISIBLE into the scene graph to improve performance.
    Virtual Flow (see below)
Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

Consider allowing ranges to be PART of the document, such that undo/redo affects them.
    Either through new UndoAbleRange interface, a new boolean on HighlightRange, or via "range.owner = tediArea.content"???

Add an "Overview" gutter on the right, which show certain HighlightRanges.
    e.g. matches in Find & Replace
    Paired punctuation at the caret position
    Words matching the word at the caret's position

    A new interface OverviewRange extends HighlightRange, which has a field : overviewHighlight : FillHighlight

    Update whenever line count changes, or HighlightRanges implementing OverviewRange are added/deleted

    Can we make this pluggable. i.e. do NOT include it in TediArea, just allow additional gutters to be added to TediArea.

Make the left gutter pluggable in the same way.
    e.g. to add "breakpoints", "super" and "sub-class" buttons against functions/fields.

Folding
    Anywhere that there's paired highlights which are on different lines add folding buttons V and ^
    For python lovers, and for indented plain text, use indentation to determine where folds can appear.
    NOTE. This would have an effect on how the API for a pluggable left gutter.

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Get BOLD etc working with non-monospaced fonts.

Consider adding back line-wrapping
    I'd have to use a TextFlow instead of Group for styled paragraphs. (Check "is Group")


VirtualFlow
-----------

Options.
Roll my own from scratch
Copy/Paste JavaFX VirtualFlow
Use Flowless

Correct layout for TediArea (Note there's no ScrollPane!)
    Scroll bar (right)
    "inner" section (left) containing :
        Gutter (left) (with line numbers)
        Content (center)
        Scroll bar (bottom)
    Overview floating section left of the scroll bar
Content will be a virtual flow, and Gutter is also a virtual flow.

If I'm going to have folding, then my data structure will be tree-like :
    Root UnFold (0..lineCount-1)
        Folded (0..10)
        UnFold (11.20)
        Folded (21,100)
            Fold(21, 40)
            UnFolded(41,60)
            Fold(60,100)
        etc.
And my Root will be in charge of converting visible indices (for the virtual flow) into paragraph indices
Note. When I implement line-wrapping, then a single Paragraph COULD be folded (so that it only ever takes up one line)

NOTE. This should be EXTERNAL to TediArea.
Have an interface Folding and the default value is an instance of class NoFolding
Then I implement TreeFolding.

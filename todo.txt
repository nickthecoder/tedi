Caret blinking needs to be started whenever the caret position moves.

Consider adding a Location class, which holds a position:Int, and also a line:Int and column:Int
Listens to something new??? so that its values update when the document changes.
caret and anchor could use these??? Make them internally mutable???
    I need to think this through.

Implement Skin using a list of paragraphsNodes

Make ParagraphNode clever enough to handle a set of styles
    i.e. break the line into pieces, where each piece can have their own style
    Use this for selection
    Later use this for search matches
        if match count > 1000 stop adding highlights.
    Later use it for syntax highlighting

Remove remaining deprecation warnings

Consider adding a gutter to the right, which shows where the match results are.
    Kate puts it IN the scroll bar, whereas IntelliJ puts it the left of the scroll bar, floating above the text.
    Copy IntelliJ - don't make it a "gutter", float it over the content.

Consider adding back line-wrapping, but set display-line-numbers=false whenever it is set.
    Likewise setting displayLineNumbers forces line-wrap = false.

Bugs
----

When text is deleted, causing a HR to be deleted, the list's listeners aren't informed
    Note, Paragraph list doesn't WANT to know!
    This isn't causing me any problems, but does limit the usefulness of the paragraphsProperty.

Current Work
------------

Next
----

Remove zero-length non-stretchy ranges during delete.
    Add test cases for stretchy and non-stretchy ranges.

Skin.changeLine is using a tmpText, and not the real Text objects. Will cause problems
    for proportional fonts with BOLD or italics ranges.

Later
-----

Only place those paragraphNodes which are VISIBLE into the scene graph to improve performance.

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

Get BOLD etc working with non-monospaced fonts.

Consider adding back line-wrapping
    I'd have to use a TextFlow instead of Group for styled paragraphs. (Check "is Group")

Consider allowing ranges to be PART of the document, such that undo/redo affects them.
    Either through a new boolean on HighlightRange, or via "range.owner = tediArea.content"???

When text is deleted, causing a HR to be deleted, the list's listeners aren't informed
    Note, Paragraph list doesn't WANT to know!

Current Work

Next

change Paragraph.text to charSequence, and add text, which does a toString.
rename "line" methods to paragraph?

is lineHeight() correct? Can the text area adjust the line spacing???

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

Get BOLD etc working with non-monospaced fonts.

Consider adding back line-wrapping

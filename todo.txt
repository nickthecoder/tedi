Working on Undo/Redo

Allow changes to be merged.
    A ReplaceTextChange merges changes to contiguous text
    Add a time limit, so that if text is being typed, then it gets merged, but if there is a pause in typing,
        then the next change will NOT be merged. Same with SelectRangeChange.

Bugs
----

Using Home key on the first line SOMETIMES the caret vanishes
Also, scrolling the view, then then typing also hides the caret.

Some positional movements use selectRange(x,x), which causes a new Change to the undo/redo list.
    I don't think this should cause a new Change

Redo a selection change does NOT show the new selection.

Is Undo/Redo exposed?

Check Undo/Redo when indenting/un-indenting - it may need improving.
    Maybe I can merge multiple Change objects into one.

Make ParagraphNode clever enough to handle a set of styles
    i.e. break the line into pieces, where each piece can have their own style
    Use this for both selection and search matches.
    Can also use it for syntax highlighting.

Search and replace.
    Matches should be highlighted in a similar way to a selection (but in a different color).
        Too-many matches > 1000? Abort.

Consider adding a gutter to the right, which shows where the match results are.
    Kate puts it IN the scroll bar, whereas IntelliJ puts it the left of the scroll bar, floating above the text.


Consider adding back line-wrapping, but set display-line-numbers=false whenever it is set.
    Likewise setting displayLineNumbers forces line-wrap = false.

"Private" API references
------------------------
    My code still references com.sum.xxx classes.

    TediAreaBehaviour uses :
        com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.Utils
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
    TediAreaSkin uses :
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.Utils
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.TextLayout

The list is getting smaller ;-)

Utils and HitInfo are needed for finding the text position a point is within a Text node.
    I can calculate the height using line height (which I think I can extract using standard APIs)
    I can calculate the column by binary chopping a line of text, and asking for its width.

When text is deleted, causing a HR to be deleted, the list's listeners aren't informed
    Note, Paragraph list doesn't WANT to know!

HitInfo
    Move boundsInLocal to a local variable.

Consider removing ParagraphList.ContentCharSequence as it isn't efficient.
    At the very least rename it, as it isn't in Content!!!

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Add font +/- buttons in the Demo.
    Some things will fail!!!

get rid of getLine?
change Paragraph.text to charSequence, and add text, which does a toString.
rename "line" methods to paragraph?

is lineHeight() correct? Can the text area adjust the line spacing???

Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

Get BOLD etc working with non-monospaced fonts.

Consider adding back line-wrapping

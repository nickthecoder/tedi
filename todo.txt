Shift-tab doesn't work without a selection.

Search and replace.
    Matches should be highlighted in a similar way to a selection (but in a different color).
    For now, limit it to single line matches???

Consider adding back line-wrapping, but set display-line-numbers=false whenever it is set.
    Likewise setting displayLineNumbers forces line-wrap = false.

"Private" API references
------------------------
    My code still references com.sum.xxx classes.

    TediAreaBehaviour uses :
        com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.Utils
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
    TediAreaSkin uses :
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.Utils
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.TextLayout
        import com.sun.javafx.tk.FontMetrics
        import com.sun.javafx.tk.Toolkit

The list is getting smaller ;-)

Utils and HitInfo are needed for finding the text position a point is within a Text node.
    I can calculate the height using line height (which I think I can extract using standard APIs)
    I can calculate the column by binary chopping a line of text, and asking for its width.

Toolkit, TextLayout and FontMetrics are all related, and are used to calculate pref widths.
    A simple workaround would be to remove PrefColumnCount and PrefRowCount
    After all, these are usually used for a TextArea within a Form, and TediArea isn't designed to be within a form.

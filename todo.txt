    Move boundsInLocal to a local variable.

Consider removing ParagraphList.ContentCharSequence as it isn't efficient.
    At the very least rename it, as it isn't in Content!!!

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Add font +/- buttons in the Demo.
    Some things will fail!!!

Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

get rid of getLine?
change Paragraph.text to charSequence, and add text, which does a toString.
rename "line" methods to paragraph?

is lineHeight() correct? Can the text area adjust the line spacing???

Get BOLD etc working with non-monospaced fonts.

Consider writing a method of loading/saving highlighted documents (not only to disc).
    e.g. for clipboard.
    Maybe a json document, with the text up front, and a list of ranges at the end.
    Shouldn't be part of TediArea.
    Option to include zero length ranges (on load AND save).

Consider adding back line-wrapping

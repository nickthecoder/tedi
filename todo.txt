My copy of BehaviourBase imports Direction from a non-public package.
    Note. Node includes this class in its API!!
    Attempt to cut that stuff out, and replace it with Node.focusNext

TediView I changed one of the properties from xxx to xxxProperty. Damn, forgot which one!


Remove context menu stuff, as it requires translations.
    Remove TediAreaSkin getString and BASE_NAME from companion

Note. TediArea uses multiple paragraphs, but the skin doesn't!!!

Remove isWrap(), as we don't want to support wrapping.

Remove promptText stuff

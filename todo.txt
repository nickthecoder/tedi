Demo is sluggish moving the caret position. Is this because of the column/line number at the top?
    I don't remember it being sluggish before.
    Maybe because its creating threads for the various extensions. Reuse existing threads?

Consider allowing ranges to be PART of the document, such that undo/redo affects them.
    Through a new UndoableRange interface

Add an "Overview" gutter on the right, which show certain HighlightRanges.
    e.g. matches in Find & Replace
    Paired punctuation at the caret position
    Words matching the word at the caret's position

    A new interface OverviewRange extends HighlightRange, which has a field : overviewHighlight : FillHighlight

    Update whenever line count changes, or HighlightRanges implementing OverviewRange are added/deleted

    Can we make this pluggable. i.e. do NOT include it in TediArea, just allow additional gutters to be added to TediArea.

Folding
    Anywhere that there's paired highlights which are on different lines add folding buttons V and ^
    For python lovers, and for indented plain text, use indentation to determine where folds can appear.

Check when layoutChildren is being called, and try to minimise this.

Consider adding back line-wrapping
    Moving up/down a line will need extra work.
    Fill styles that span multiple lines will be tricky.
    In layout, if content's width changes, then re-lay out all existing nodes, and fillViewport() (as there may be space for more)
    Have two modes for the horizontal scroll :
        When wrapping is disabled. The node's heights are calculated using -1.0 (i.e. limitless)
        When wrapping is enabled. The node's heights are calculated using the viewport width
            In which case, never show the scrollbar???

Create a Rich Text Demo, where styles are part of the document (undoable)
    Only makes sense if wrapping is implemented.

Implement Skin using a list of paragraphsNodes
    Create a Group, initially with one Text, then add/change via a paragraph listener.
        While in developing, keep the old paragraphNode
    Update font in a listener
        Add font +/- buttons in the Demo.


Make ParagraphNode clever enough to handle a set of styles
    i.e. break the line into pieces, where each piece can have their own style
    Use this for selection
    Later use this for search matches
        if match count > 1000 stop adding highlights.
    Later use it for syntax highlighting

Remove remaining deprecation warnings

Move the gutter OUTSIDE of the scrollbar, so that it isn't scrolled away horizontally.

Consider adding a gutter to the right, which shows where the match results are.
    Kate puts it IN the scroll bar, whereas IntelliJ puts it the left of the scroll bar, floating above the text.
    Copy IntelliJ - don't make it a "gutter", float it over the content.

Consider adding back line-wrapping
    Set set display-line-numbers=false whenever it is set.
    Likewise setting displayLineNumbers forces line-wrap = false.

    OR, build the line numbers as a set of Text objects, and line them up with the main Text nodes.

    This would prevent some optimisations later though (allowing only *visible* nodes to be created/updated).

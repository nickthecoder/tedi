Bugs
----

LineNumbers change font (seemingly at random). Maybe a gc issue?
    Note, only the "font family" changes (from monospace to the default (proportional) font.
    This causes them not to line up with the content.

Next
----

Indent/unindent to work with undo/redo

Do better next/prev word navigation (more in keeping with code. i.e. co.uk.nickthecoder.foo is treated as 4 words.

Tab key to indent a block (when there is a selection)
Shift-tab to un-indent a block (unless in read-only mode, in which case perform the normal navigation).

Later
-----

Goto (line number and column)

Search and replace.
    Matches should be highlighted in a similar way to a selection (but in a different color).
    For now, limit it to single line matches???

"Private" API references
------------------------
    My code still references com.sum.xxx classes.

    BehaviourBase imports Direction from a non-public package.

    TediAreaBehaviour uses :
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.TextInputControlSkin
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
    TediAreaSkin uses :
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.Utils
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.input.ExtendedInputMethodRequests
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.HitInfo
        import com.sun.javafx.scene.text.TextLayout
        import com.sun.javafx.tk.FontMetrics
        import com.sun.javafx.tk.Toolkit

Optimisation
------------
The skin uses one big Text object holding ALL of the text.
    This was a hangover from the original TextArea
The line numbers are also one big Text object.
